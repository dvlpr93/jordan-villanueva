            <h3 class="about-question">Where did I grow up?</h3>
            <p>
              I grew up in Azle, just outside of Fort Worth, and attended
              Primera Iglesia Bautista in Azle. I spent a lot of time growing up
              on the north side of Fort Worth.

            </h3>
            <p>
              I graduated from Howard Payne University with a Bachelor of Arts
              in youth ministry and Spanish. I received my Master of Divinity
              from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. I am working on my
              Ph.D. at Southwestern Seminary; with a focus in church history.

            <h3 class="about-question">Why do I feel called into ministry?</h3>
            <p>
              I received my call to ministry as a teenager at Campamento at
              Mount Lebanon Camp in Cedar Hill. My dear friend Tiny Dominguez
              was the speaker and was giving the call for anyone who felt God
              calling them to serve him in vocational ministry. I had just
              graduated high school and was about to begin attending HPU to play
              soccer, never thinking I would be studying to become a pastor.
              Yet, at camp that summer in 2008, I felt the Lord calling me to
              step forward and to serve in this capacity. It just so happened,
              that fall I was going to attend a Baptist university with a
              Christian Studies department. I believe the Lord made that happen.

            <h3 class="about-question">How did I come to faith in Christ?</h3>
            <p>
              I grew up in a church. I heard the stories, and I heard the
              gospel. However, I knew of God but did not know him personally. It
              was not until I was 17 years old that I came to a fork in the road
              in my life. I had hit a valley due to the choices I had made. I
              realized in my mother's driveway I had been putting my hope in the
              wrong things. I did not have a typical "walk the aisle" moment. I
              had the realization, sitting broken on the hood of my car as a
              teenager in mother's driveway, I needed to make Jesus the Lord of
              my life and follow him.

            <h3 class="about-question">
              Where else have I served in ministry, and what were my positions
              there?
            </h3>
            <p>
              I first served as youth minister at Primera Iglesia Bautista in
              Brownwood. I then served in the youth ministry at First Baptist
              Church in El Paso, and then as youth pastor at Grace Temple
              Baptist Chruch in Oak Cliff.

            <h3 class="about-question">
              What is my favorite aspect of ministry? Why?
            </h3>
            <p>
              I really enjoy investing in young people, whether to disciple
              someone who just recently has come to faith, or even walking
              alongside younger pastors and ministers. I may not have as much
              wisdom and experience to give away as some who have been in
              ministry for decades, but I want to give away what I have to
              offer.

            <h3 class="about-question">
              How has my ministry or my perspective on ministry changed?
            </h3>
            <p>
              I started out in youth ministry. I served in student ministry for
              seven years. The honest truth was I thought I would be in student
              ministry forever. The Lord had other plans. Yet, even though my
              title and responsibilites changed, the foundational principles
              never did. I have continued to teach truth and love people even in
              this new context.

          <!-- Slide 7 -->
          <div class="carousel-item container-fluid">
            <h3 class="about-question">
              How do I expect ministry to change in the next 10 to 20 years?
            </h3>
            <p>
              I see a pruning season coming. Not in the sense of people, but
              programming. I believe the church has become metaphorical hoarders
              in the sense we have created this huge institutional cruise ship
              that is extremely heavy and slow to turn due to all the stuff that
              has been associated with the church. I believe the pandemic has
              shown that type of institution can't function well in this
              fast-changing world. The church needs to have the capability to
              pivot in different ways going forward. I believe we will begin to
              take away the fluff in this stripping-down process, so we will get
              back down to the basic fundamentals of what it looks like to love
              God and love people.
